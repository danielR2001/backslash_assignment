# Backslash Assignment


## Solution

* First thing first after I read the assignment I started analyzing the JSON
* I started by solving the hardest task in the assignment and that is filtering the graph (tree)
* The first filter I did was of filtering top to bottom, it took the most time as that was the key for the opposite filtering direction.
* I have completed the the second filter.
* After that I tested the 3 filters
  1. Routes that start in a public service ( "publicExposed": true )
  2. Routes that end in Sink (rds/sql).
  3. Routes that have a vulnerability in one of the nodes.
* I have created the express server (from a template that I have) and tested it with postman.
* I have created a react app (from a template that I have)
* I have connected front to back
* Tested the full cycle and was happy with the results :D
